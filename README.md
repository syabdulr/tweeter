Abdul Syed's Tweeter Project

ThisTweeter Project is a endeavor to create a Twitter clone with a simple, single-page design.

I will use HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, AJAX for the front-end, and Node.js, Express for the back-end.

The web page allows for users to tweet and see the tweets in real time with the correct time stamps. It also features a neat little animation indicating that the user can tweet and once the user has clicked on the animation, it will guide them to the correct spot to start tweeting!
